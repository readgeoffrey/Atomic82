                                        Most of us have heard of Flint. But a lot of us don’t realize that this is a nation-wide issue. In fact, a recent Reuter’s study found 1,100 communities across the country have lead-in-water issues as bad or worse than the Michigan town.

                                        Health experts all agree: Lead is terrible for your brain and body. It hinders brain function, stunts growth in children, and has other long-term health implications. Though the EPA says that some (up to 15 parts per billion) lead is ok, there is no “good” level of lead. Especially for infants, children, and those with particular health conditions who are more susceptible to contaminants.

                                        The EPA regulates lead levels in water. They allow for certain amounts of lead in your water before it is considered "toxic". Meanwhile, health experts agree: Any level of lead consumption is unsafe. Especially for newborns, children, the elderly, or the infirm.

                                You can call your local water utility and they should be able to do it for free. Though that might be annoying...

                                You can also go to Home Depot or Amazon and buy DIY testing strips! However, we’ve used these, and they’re just not good enough. To really have confidence in the test, you'd want to send a sample off to a certified lab. But which lab to do you call? How do i find them? Who will work with individual consumers?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Through smart packaging and simple mail-order delivery, we bring the power of lab-quality testing services into the modern age. We want you to know more about the water, the clear liquid of life, that you and your family are consuming.

                                We aren't in the business of scaring you into buying a test. But we do want to help you understand your risks. To simplify your life without compromising integrity. That’s what we do.

                                        We don't use some crappy testing strip you find on Amazon - we send your water sample to our professional, government certified testing labs. They run their tests to look for lead using advanced, state of the art testing equipment. They can find trace amounts of lead down to 1 part per billion! We know you probably aren't a scientist. So after the lab geeks do their analysis, we send you an easy to understand report, complete with recommendations for what to do next.

                                Old houses: In 1986 Congress passed a law banning the use of lead water pipes in new homes. The problem is that most of us live in houses built before 1986.

                                Insufficient testing: Most water testing done in communities is done at the treatment plant. Water then travels from there through city water mains, through your house's water pipes, and through your water fixtures. Each place is a point at which stuff can get into your water before you drink it.

                                        Most water testing done in communities is done at the treatment plant. Water then travels from there through city water mains, through your house's water pipes, and through your water fixtures. Each place is a point at which stuff can get into your water before you drink it.

                        <p>
                            We are two guys who have spent years working in and around government to make public services better. After the stories from Flint, Michigan hit the headlines, we started worrying about our water. We wanted to make sure our water was safe to drink. We wanted to make sure our family's water was safe to drink.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We found a number of testing kits online and in stores, but those weren't very good. Then we tried to contact our local water testing labs, but ordering a single test was complicated. Government labs were too slow, if they exist at all. Commercial labs were too expensive. Both mainly work with industry and companies.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            So we made a company.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We've figured out how to work with professional, government certified labs so you don't have to. We can take advantage of volume pricing to get you cheaper tests.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We can simplify a messy world, so you can better understand how your family's health is effected by what's coming out of your tap.
