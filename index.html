                                If you live in a city, your local water utility does most of its tests at their local water treatment plants. But from there, the water travels from through a long system of pipes: through water mains buried under the streets, into the water pipes under your house, through your kitchen pipes, and finally out of your faucet or refrigerator.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Your local city and utility does (or at least, by law, should) test for lead at a sample of homes. However, the only have to test a small number of homes in your city and they don't necessarily do it every year.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The water your family drinks and cooks with has gotten to you through it's own path that no one else's water has traveled. Each step along that path involves different pipes and connection points installed and managed by different companies and people.

But many people donâ€™t realize that, due in part to underinvestment in infrastructure around the country and a lax regulatory system, water issues are a growing conversation in communities around the country.

                                       Lead pipes used to be very common in cities and houses before we knew how bad lead was to human health. In 1986, a law outlawed their use in new homes, but that law didn't require replacing the lead pipes already out there. Years later, many cities are realizing they didn't keep great records. Now they aren't sure if they have lead pipes, or if they do, they don't know where exactly those pipes are.

                                        Doctors and public health experts all agree: Lead is terrible for your brain and body. It hinders brain function, stunts growth in children, has long-term health implications as it builds up in your body over time. This is hard to notice since your water seems normal: You can't see nor can you see taste lead when it's in water.

                                Children younger than 6 years are especially vulnerable to lead poisoning, which can severely affect mental and physical development. At very high levels, lead poisoning can be fatal.

                                At Home Depot and on Amazon, you are able to buy at-home testing strips for about 20 dollars. (We found price ranges from 19 to 35 dollars.) However, when we did this, we found these testing strips hard to read. It turns out, they are unregulated, based on bad science, and overall just difficult to trust.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                To really have confidence in your test, you'll want to sendÂ a water sample off to a certified lab. And here you can do the research if you'd like. Which lab to call? How do you find them? Which ones work with normal consumers and not soley with industry? Will they help me once I get my results? Shouldn't my city come to my house and do this for me?

                                We don't use the unreliable testing strips you can find on Amazon or your area department store. We send your water sample to our professional, government-certified drinking water testing labs. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Our labs test your water for lead using advanced, state of the art testing equipment. Specifically, they use a methodology called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductively_coupled_plasma_mass_spectrometry">inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry</a> to determine not just what is in your water but how much.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The EPA regulatory threshold for taking drastic action is 15 parts per billion. However, this is a bit decieving: The CDC, doctors and health professionals, and even the EPA themselves will tell you that <strong>there is NO safe amount of lead</strong>. Even a little bit of lead can build up over time and be harmful, particularly to growing kids and people with health concerns.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The chemists we work with can find trace amounts of lead down to 1 part per billion. Meanwhile, many labs we've talked to only give information down to 5 parts per billion. Since there is no such thing as a safe level of lead, we think this level of specificity matters.

                        <p>
                            We are two guys who have spent years working in and around government to make public services better. After the stories from Flint, Michigan hit the headlines, we started worrying about our water. We wanted to make sure our water was safe to drink. We wanted to make sure our family's water was safe to drink.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We found a number of testing kits online and in stores, but those weren't very trustworthy. Then we tried to contact our local water testing labs, but ordering a single test was complicated. Government labs were too slow, hard to navigate, and face-less. Commercial labs were too expensive and only provided the data - no recommendations for what to do next. Both told us they spend most of their time with industry and companies.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            So we made a company.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We've found the top professional, government-certified labs so you don't have to do the searching. We've figured out how to work with them so you don't have to. We can take advantage of volume pricing to get you cheaper tests. We can take care of all the complicated business stuff these labs want, so all you have to do is click a button to order a test.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Water is important! After years of under-investment and with the changes of climate change now affecting us, we fear that the days of taking our drinking water for granted may be behind us. We hope and advocate for policies to modernize our water system. In fact we hope those happen and they take us out of business.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            But in the mean time, we think you may want to consider your water and test it yourself, if only just to make sure. And weâ€™ve built a product and service that makes that process simple, fast, and trustworthy.
