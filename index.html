                                        Health experts all agree: Lead is terrible for your brain and body. It hinders brain function, stunts growth in children, and has other long-term health implications. Though the EPA set an acceptable threshhold of lead in water, there is no “good” amount of lead. It's especially dangerous for infants, children, the elderly, and the infirm.

                                        Most water testing done in communities is done at the local treatment plant. However, water then travels from there through city water mains, to your house's water pipes, and out your sink. Lead from any of these pipes could contaminate your water before you drink it.

                                Children younger than 6 years are especially vulnerable to lead poisoning, which can severely affect mental and physical development. At very high levels, lead poisoning can be fatal.

                                You can go to Home Depot or Amazon and buy DIY testing strips, but these are hard to read, unregulated, and untrustworthy. They’re just not very good. To really have confidence in the test, you'd want to send a sample off to a certified lab. But which lab to do you call? How do you find them? Which ones work with individual consumers?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                With online ordering, to-your-door delivery, and partnerships with professional, government certified water testing labs, we bring the power of lab-quality testing services to the people who need them the most. 
                            </p>

                                We aren't in the business of scaring you into buying a test. But lead in drinking water is a real threat to many people, and we want to give you the peace of mind that the water you and your family are consuming is safe and lead-free. To simplify your life without compromising integrity. That’s what we do.

Water then travels from there through city water mains, through your house's water pipes, and through your water fixtures. Each place is a point at which stuff can get into your water before you drink it.

                        <p>
                            We are two guys who have spent years working in and around government to make public services better. After the stories from Flint, Michigan hit the headlines, we started worrying about our water. We wanted to make sure our water was safe to drink. We wanted to make sure our family's water was safe to drink.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We found a number of testing kits online and in stores, but those weren't very trustworthy. Then we tried to contact our local water testing labs, but ordering a single test was complicated. Government labs were too slow, if they existed at all. Commercial labs were too expensive. Both told us they mainly work with industry and companies.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            So we made a company.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We've figured out how to work with professional, government-certified labs so you don't have to. We can take advantage of volume pricing to get you cheaper tests. We can take care of all the complicated business stuff these labs want, so all you have to do is click one button to order a test.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We simplify a messy world so you understand how the water that comes out of your tap effects your family's health.
